      THE RAID OF THE GUERILLA
    </h1>
    <h2>
      By Charles Egbert Craddock <br /> <br /> 1911
    </h2>
    <p>
      <br /><br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Judgment day was coming to Tanglefoot Cove&mdash;somewhat in advance of
      the expectation of the rest of the world. Immediate doom impended. A
      certain noted guerilla, commanding a reckless troop, had declared a stern
      intention of raiding this secluded nook among the Great Smoky Mountains,
      and its denizens could but tremble at the menace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Few and feeble folk were they. The volunteering spirit rife in the early
      days of the Civil War had wrought the first depletion in the number. Then
      came, as time wore on, the rigors of the conscription, with an extension
      of the limits of age from the very young to the verge of the venerable,
      thus robbing, as was said, both the cradle and the grave. Now only the
      ancient weaklings and the frail callow remained of the male population
      among the women and girls, who seemed mere supernumeraries in the scheme
      of creation, rated by the fitness to bear arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      So feeble a community of non-combatants might hardly compass a warlike
      affront calculated to warrant reprisal, but the predominant Union spirit
      of East Tennessee was all a-pulse in the Cove, and the deed was no trifle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;T war Ethelindy&rsquo;s deed,&rdquo; her grandfather mumbled, his quivering lips
      close to the knob of his stick, on which his palsied, veinous hands
      trembled as he sat in his armchair on the broad hearth of the main room in
      his little log cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethelinda Brusie glanced quickly, furtively, at his pondering, wrinkled
      old face under the broad brim of his white wool hat, which he still wore,
      though indoors and with the night well advanced. Then she fixed her
      anxious, excited blue eyes once more on the flare of the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lawd! ye jes&rsquo; now f &lsquo;und that out, dad?&rdquo; exclaimed her widowed mother,
      busied in her evening task of carding wool on one side of the deep
      chimney, built of clay and sticks, and seeming always the imminent prey of
      destruction. But there it had stood for a hundred years, dispensing light
      and warmth and cheer, itself more inflammable than the great hickory logs
      that had summer still among their fibres and dripped sap odorously as they
      sluggishly burned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethelinda cast a like agitated glance on the speaker, then her gaze
      reverted to the fire. She had the air of being perched up, as if to escape
      the clutching waves of calamity, as she sat on a high, inverted splint
      basket, her feet not touching the puncheons of the rude floor, one hand
      drawing close about her the red woollen skirt of her dress. She seemed
      shrunken even from her normal small size, and she listened to the
      reproachful recital of her political activity with a shrinking dismay on
      her soft, roseate face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nuthin&rsquo; would do Ethelindy,&rdquo; her granny lifted an accusatory voice, still
      knitting briskly, though she looked rebukingly over her spectacles at the
      cowering girl, &ldquo;when that thar Union <i>dee</i>-tachmint rid into
      Tanglefoot Cove like a rat into a trap&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; interposed Mrs. Brusie, &ldquo;through mistakin&rsquo; it fur Greenbrier Cove.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nuthin&rsquo; would do Ethelindy but she mus&rsquo; up an&rsquo; offer to show the officer
      the way out by that thar cave what tunnels through the spur of the
      mounting down todes the bluffs, what sca&rsquo;cely one o&rsquo; the boys left in the
      Cove would know now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Else he&rsquo;d hev been capshured,&rdquo; Ethelinda humbly submitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;&mdash;the ruffles of her grandmother&rsquo;s cap were terrible to view as
      they wagged at her with the nodding vehemence of her prelection&mdash;&ldquo;an&rsquo; 
      <i>you</i> will be capshured now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl visibly winced, and one of the three small boys lying about the
      hearth, sharing the warm flags with half a dozen dogs, whimpered aloud in
      sympathetic fright. The others preserved a breathless, anxious silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You-uns mus&rsquo; be powerful keerful ter say nuthin&rsquo; &lsquo;bout Ethelindy&rsquo;s hand
      in that escape of the Fed&rsquo;ral cavalry&rdquo;&mdash;the old grandfather roused
      himself to a politic monition. &ldquo;Mebbe the raiders won&rsquo;t find it out&mdash;an&rsquo; 
      the folks in the Cove dun&rsquo;no&rsquo; who done it, nuther.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, bes&rsquo; be keerful, sure,&rdquo; the gran-dame rejoined. &ldquo;Fur they puts
      wimmin folks in jail out yander in the flat woods;&rdquo; still glibly knitting,
      she jerked her head toward the western world outside the limits of the
      great ranges. &ldquo;Whenst I war a gal I war acquainted with a woman what
      pizened her husband, an&rsquo; they kep&rsquo; her in jail a consider&rsquo;ble time&mdash;a
      senseless thing ter do ter jail her, ter my mind, fur he war a shif&rsquo;less
      no-&rsquo;count fool, an&rsquo; nobody but her would hev put up with him ez long ez
      she did. The jedge an&rsquo; jury thunk the same, fur they &lsquo;lowed ez she war
      crazy&mdash;an&rsquo; so she war, ter hev ever married him! They turned her
      loose, but she never got another husband&mdash;I never knowed a man-person
      but what was skittish &lsquo;bout any unhealthy meddlin&rsquo; with his vittles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She paused to count the stitches on her needles, the big shadow of her
      cap-ruffles bobbing on the daubed and chinked log walls in antic mimicry,
      while down Ethelinda&rsquo;s pink cheeks the slow tears coursed at the prospect
      of such immurement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jes&rsquo; kase I showed a stranger his path&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; two hundred an&rsquo; fifty mo&rsquo;&mdash;spry, good-lookin&rsquo; youngsters, able
      to do the rebs a power o&rsquo; damage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I war &lsquo;feared they&rsquo;d git capshured. That man, the leader, he stopped me
      down on the bank o&rsquo; the creek whar I war a-huntin&rsquo; of the cow, an&rsquo; he axed
      &lsquo;bout the roads out&rsquo;n the Cove, an&rsquo; I tole him thar war no way out
      &lsquo;ceptin&rsquo; by the road he had jes&rsquo; come, an&rsquo; a path through a sorter cave or
      tunnel what the creek had washed out in the spur o&rsquo; the mounting, ez could
      be travelled whenst the channel war dry or toler&rsquo;ble low, an&rsquo; he axed me
      ter show him that underground way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; ye war full willin,&rdquo; said Mrs. Brusie, in irritation, &ldquo;though ye
      knowed that thar guerilla, Ackert, hed been movin&rsquo; heaven an&rsquo; earth ter
      overhaul Tolhurst&rsquo;s command before they could reach the main body. An&rsquo; 
      hyar they war cotched like a rat in a trap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was sure that the Cornfeds, ez hed seen them lope down inter the Cove,
      would be waitin&rsquo; ter capshur them when they kem up the road agin&mdash;I
      jes&rsquo; showed him how ter crope out through the cave,&rdquo; Ethelinda sobbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How in perdition did they find thar way through that thar dark hole?&mdash;I
      can&rsquo;t sense that!&rdquo; the old man suddenly mumbled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They had lanterns an&rsquo; some pine-knots, grandad, what they lighted, an&rsquo; 
      the leader sent a squad ter &lsquo;reconnoitre,&rsquo; ez he called it. An&rsquo; whilst he
      waited he stood an&rsquo; talked ter me about the roads in Greenbrier an&rsquo; the
      lay o&rsquo; the land over thar. He war full per-lite an&rsquo; genteel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be bound ye looked like a &lsquo;crazy Jane,&rsquo;&rdquo; cried the grandmother, with
      sudden exasperation. &ldquo;Yer white sun-bonnet plumb off an&rsquo; a-hangin&rsquo; down on
      yer shoulders, an&rsquo; yer yaller hair all a-blowsin&rsquo; at loose eends, stiddier
      bein&rsquo; plaited up stiff an&rsquo; tight an&rsquo; personable, an&rsquo; yer face burned pink
      in the sun, stiddier like yer skin ginerally looks, fine an&rsquo; white ez a
      pan o&rsquo; fraish milk, an&rsquo; the flabby, slinksy skirt o&rsquo; that yaller calico
      dress &lsquo;thout no starch in it, a-flappin&rsquo; an&rsquo; whirlin&rsquo; in the wind&mdash;shucks!
      I dun&rsquo;no&rsquo; <i>whut</i> the man could hev thought o&rsquo; you-uns, dressed out
      that-a-way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He war toler&rsquo;ble well pleased with me now, sure!&rdquo; retorted Ethelinda,
      stung to a blunt self-assertion. &ldquo;He keered mo&rsquo; about a good-lookin&rsquo; road
      than a good-lookin&rsquo; gal then. Whenst the squad kem back an&rsquo; reported the
      passage full safe for man an&rsquo; beastis the leader tuk a purse o&rsquo; money
      out&rsquo;n his pocket an&rsquo; held it out to me&mdash;though he said it couldn&rsquo;t
      express his thanks.&rsquo; But I held my hands behind me an&rsquo; wouldn&rsquo;t take it.
      Then he called up another man an&rsquo; made him open a bag, an&rsquo; he snatched up
      my empty milk-piggin&rsquo; an&rsquo; poured it nigh full o&rsquo; green coffee in the bean&mdash;it
      be skeerce ez gold an&rsquo; nigh ez precious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; <i>what</i> did you do with it, Ethelindy?&rdquo; her mother asked,
      significantly&mdash;not for information, but for the renewal of discussion
      and to justify the repetition of rebukes. These had not been few.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know,&rdquo; the girl returned, sullenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I</i> do,&rdquo; the glib grandmother interposed. &ldquo;Ye jes&rsquo; gin we-uns a
      sniff an&rsquo; a sup, an&rsquo; then ye tuk the kittle that leaks an&rsquo; shook the rest
      of the coffee beans from out yer milk-piggin inter it, an&rsquo; sot out an&rsquo; 
      marched yer-self through the laurel&mdash;I wonder nuthin&rsquo; didn&rsquo;t ketch
      ye! howsomever naught is never in danger&mdash;an&rsquo; went ter that horspital
      camp o&rsquo; the rebels on Big Injun Mounting&mdash;smallpox horspital it is&mdash;an&rsquo; 
      gin that precious coffee away to the enemies o&rsquo; yer kentry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody comes nor goes ter that place&mdash;hell itself ain&rsquo;t so avoided,&rdquo;
       said Mrs. Brusie, her forehead corrugated with sudden recurrence of
      anxiety. &ldquo;Nobody else in this world would have resked it, &lsquo;ceptin&rsquo; that
      headin&rsquo; contrairy gal, Ethelindy Brusie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never resked nuthin,&rdquo; protested Ethelinda. &ldquo;I stopped at the head of a
      bluff far off, an&rsquo; hollered down ter &lsquo;em in the clearin&rsquo; an&rsquo; held up the
      kittle. An&rsquo; two or three rebs war out of thar tents in the clearin&rsquo;&mdash;thar
      be a good sight o&rsquo; new graves up thar!&mdash;an&rsquo; them men war hollerin&rsquo; 
      an&rsquo; wavin&rsquo; me away, till they seen what I war doin&rsquo;; jes&rsquo; settin&rsquo; down the
      kittle an&rsquo; startin&rsquo; off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She gazed meditatively into the fire, of set purpose avoiding the eyes
      fixed upon her, and sought to justify her course.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knowed ez we-uns hed got used ter doin&rsquo; &lsquo;thout coffee, an&rsquo; don&rsquo;t feel
      the need of it now. We-uns air well an&rsquo; stout, an&rsquo; live in our good home
      an&rsquo; beside our own h&rsquo;a&rsquo;th-stone; an&rsquo; they air sick, an&rsquo; pore, an&rsquo; cast
      out, an&rsquo; I reckon they ain&rsquo;t ever been remembered before in gifts. An&rsquo; I
      &lsquo;lowed the coffee, bein&rsquo; unexpected an&rsquo; a sorter extry, mought put some
      fraish heart an&rsquo; hope in &lsquo;em&mdash;leastwise show &lsquo;em ez God don&rsquo;t &lsquo;low
      &lsquo;em ter be plumb furgot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She still gazed meditatively at the fire as if it held a scroll of her
      recollections, which she gradually interpreted anew. &ldquo;I looked back wunst,
      an&rsquo; one o&rsquo; them rebs had sot down on a log an&rsquo; war sobbin&rsquo; ez ef his heart
      would bust. An&rsquo; another of &lsquo;em war signin, at me agin an&rsquo; agin, like he
      was drawin&rsquo; a cross in the air&mdash;one pass down an&rsquo; then one across&mdash;an&rsquo; 
      the other reb war jes&rsquo; laffin&rsquo; fur joy, and wunst in a while he yelled
      out: &lsquo;Blessin&rsquo;s on ye! Blessin&rsquo;s! Blessin&rsquo;s!&rsquo; I dun&rsquo;no&rsquo; how fur I hearn
      that sayin&rsquo;. The rocks round the creek war repeatin&rsquo; it, whenst I crossed
      the f oot-bredge. I dun&rsquo;no what the feller meant&mdash;mought hev been
      crazy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A tricksy gust stirred at the door as if a mischievous hand twitched the
      latch-string, but it hung within. There was a pause. The listening
      children on the hearth sighed and shifted their posture; one of the hounds
      snored sonorously in the silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nuthin&rsquo; crazy thar &lsquo;ceptin&rsquo; you-uns!&mdash;one fool gal&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      all!&rdquo; said her grandmother, with her knitting-needles and her spectacles
      glittering in the firelight. &ldquo;That is a pest camp. Ye mought hev cotch the
      smallpox. I be lookm&rsquo; fur ye ter break out with it any day. When the war
      is over an&rsquo; the men come back to the Cove, none of &lsquo;em will so much as
      look at ye, with yer skin all pock-marked&mdash;fair an&rsquo; fine as it is
      now, like a pan of fraish milk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, granny, it won&rsquo;t be sp&rsquo;ilt! The camp war too fur off&mdash;an&rsquo; thar
      warn&rsquo;t a breath o&rsquo; wind. I never went a-nigh &lsquo;em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dun&rsquo;no&rsquo; how fur smallpox kin travel&mdash;an&rsquo; it jes&rsquo; mulls and mulls
      in ye afore it breaks out&mdash;don&rsquo;t it, S&rsquo;briny?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ax me,&rdquo; said Mrs. Brusie, with a worried air. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t no yerb
      doctor, nor nurse tender, nuther. Ethelindy is beyond my understandin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was beyond her own understanding, as she sat weeping slowly, silently.
      The aspect of those forlorn graves, that recorded the final ebbing of hope
      and life at the pest camp, had struck her recollection with a most
      poignant appeal. Strangers, wretches, dying alone, desolate outcasts, the
      terror of their kind, the epitome of repulsion&mdash;they were naught to
      her! Yet they represented humanity in its helplessness, its suffering, its
      isolated woe, and its great and final mystery; she felt vaguely grieved
      for their sake, and she gave the clay that covered them, still crude red
      clods with not yet a blade of grass, the fellowship of her tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      A thrill of masculine logic stirred uneasily in the old man&rsquo;s disused
      brain. &ldquo;Tell me <i>one</i> thing, Ethelindy,&rdquo; he said, lifting his bleared
      eyes as he clasped his tremulous hands more firmly on the head of his
      stick&mdash;&ldquo;tell me this&mdash;which side air you-uns on, ennyhow,
      Ethelindy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fur the Union,&rdquo; said Ethelinda, still weeping, and now and then
      wiping her sapphire eyes with the back of her hand, hard and tanned, but
      small in proportion to her size. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fur the Union&mdash;fust an&rsquo; last
      an&rsquo; all the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man wagged his head solemnly with a blight of forecast on his
      wrinkled, aged face. &ldquo;That thar sayin&rsquo; is goin&rsquo; ter be mighty hard ter
      live up to whilst Jerome Ackert&rsquo;s critter company is a-raidin&rsquo; of
      Tanglefoot Cove.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The presence of the &ldquo;critter company&rdquo; was indeed calculated to inspire a
      most obsequious awe. It was an expression of arbitrary power which one
      might ardently wish directed elsewhere. From the moment that the echoes of
      the Cove caught the first elusive strain of the trumpet, infinitely sweet
      and clear and compelling, yet somehow ethereal, unreal, as if blown down
      from the daylight moon, a filmy lunar semblance in the bland blue sky, the
      denizens of Tanglefoot began to tremulously confer together, and to
      skitter like frightened rabbits from house to house. Tanglefoot Cove is
      some four miles long, and its average breadth is little more than a mile.
      On all sides the great Smoky Mountains rise about the cuplike hollow, and
      their dense gigantic growths of hickory and poplar, maple and gum, were
      aglow, red and golden, with the largesse of the generous October. The
      underbrush or the jungles of laurel that covered the steeps rendered
      outlet through the forests impracticable, and indeed the only road was
      invisible save for a vague line among the dense pines of a precipitous
      slope, where on approach it would materialize under one&rsquo;s feet as a wheel
      track on either side of a line of frosted weeds, which the infrequent
      passing of wagon-beds had bent and stunted, yet had not sufficed to break.
    </p>
    <p>
      The blacksmith&rsquo;s shop, the centre of the primitive civilization, had soon
      an expectant group in its widely flaring doors, for the smith had had
      enough of the war, and had come back to wistfully, hopelessly haunt his
      anvil like some uneasy ghost visiting familiar scenes in which he no more
      bears a part;&mdash;a minié-ball had shattered his stanch hammer-arm, and
      his duties were now merely advisory to a clumsy apprentice. This was a
      half-witted fellow, a giant in strength, but not to be trusted with
      firearms. In these days of makeweights his utility had been discovered,
      and now with the smith&rsquo;s hammer in his hand he joined the group, his
      bulging eyes all a-stare and his loose lips hanging apart. The old justice
      of the peace, whose office was a sinecure, since the war had run the law
      out of the Cove, came with a punctilious step, though with a sense of
      futility and abated dignity, and at every successive note of the distant
      trumpet these wights experienced a tense bracing of the nerves to await
      helplessly the inevitable and, alas! the inexorable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They say that he is a tumble, tumble man,&rdquo; the blacksmith averred, ever
      and anon rubbing the stump of his amputated hammer-arm, in which, though
      bundled in its jeans&rsquo; sleeve, he had the illusion of the sensation of its
      hand and fingers. He suddenly shaded his brow with his broad palm to eye
      that significant line which marked the road among the pines on the eastern
      slope, beyond the Indian corn that stood tall and rank of growth in the
      rich bottom-lands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethelinda&rsquo;s heart sank. All unprescient of the day&rsquo;s impending event, she
      had come to the forge with the sley of her loom to be mended, and she now
      stood holding the long shaft in her mechanical clasp, while she listened
      spell-bound to the agitated talk of the group. The boughs of a great
      yellow hickory waved above her head; near by was the trough, and here a
      horse, brought to be shod, was utilizing the interval by a draught; he had
      ceased to draw in the clear, cold spring water, but still stood with his
      muzzle close to the surface, his lips dripping, gazing with un-imagined
      thoughts at the reflection of his big equine eyes, the blue sky inverted,
      the dappling yellow leaves, more golden even than the sunshine, and the
      glimmering flight of birds, with a stellular light upon their wings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A turrible man?&mdash;w-w-well,&rdquo; stuttered the idiot, who had of late
      assumed all the port of coherence; he snatched and held a part in the
      colloquy, so did the dignity of labor annul the realization of his
      infirmity, &ldquo;then I&rsquo;d be obleeged ter him ef&mdash;ef&mdash;ef he&rsquo;d stay
      out&rsquo;n Tanglefoot Cove.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So would I.&rdquo; The miller laughed uneasily. But for the corrugations of
      time, one might not have known if it were flour or age that had so
      whitened his long beard, which hung quivering down over the breast of his
      jeans coat, of an indeterminate hue under its frosting from the hopper.
      &ldquo;He hev tuk up a tumble spite at Tanglefoot Cove.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The blacksmith nodded. &ldquo;They say that he &lsquo;lowed ez traitors orter be
      treated like traitors. But <i>I</i> be a-goin&rsquo; ter tell him that the
      Confederacy hev got one arm off&rsquo;n me more&rsquo;n its entitled to, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m
      willin&rsquo; ter call it quits at that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; ter do him no good ter raid the Cove,&rdquo; an ancient farmer
      averred; &ldquo;an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s agin&rsquo; the rebel rule, ennyhows, ter devastate the
      kentry they live off&rsquo;n&mdash;it&rsquo;s like sawin&rsquo; off the bough ye air sittin&rsquo; 
      on.&rdquo; His eyes dwelt with a fearful affection on the laden fields; his old
      stoop-shouldered back had bent yet more under the toil that had brought
      his crop to this perfection, with the aid of the children whose labor was
      scarcely worth the strenuosity requisite to control their callow wiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shucks! He&rsquo;s a guerilla&mdash;he is!&rdquo; retorted the blacksmith.
      &ldquo;Accountable ter nobody! Hyar ter-day an&rsquo; thar ter-morrer. Rides light.
      Two leetle Parrott guns is the most weight he carries.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The idiot&rsquo;s eyes began to widen with slow and baffled speculation. &ldquo;Whut&mdash;w-whut
      ails him ter take arter Tangle-foot? W-w&mdash;&rdquo; his great loose lips
      trembled with unformed words as he gazed his eager inquiry from one to
      another. Under normal circumstances it would have remained contemptuously
      unanswered, but in these days in Tanglefoot Cove a man, though a
      simpleton, was yet a man, and inherently commanded respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A bird o&rsquo; the air mus&rsquo; hev carried the matter that Tolhurst&rsquo;s troops hed
      rid inter Tanglefoot Cove by mistake fur Greenbrier, whar they war ter
      cross ter jine the Fed&rsquo;rals nigh the Cohuttas. An&rsquo; that guerilla, Ackert,
      hed been ridin&rsquo; a hundred mile at a hand-gallop ter overhaul him, an&rsquo; 
      knowin&rsquo; thar warn&rsquo;t but one outlet to Tanglefoot Cove, he expected ter
      capshur the Feds as they kem out agin. So he sot himself ter ambush
      Tolhurst, an&rsquo; waited fur him <i>up</i> thar amongst the pines an&rsquo; the
      laurel&mdash;an&rsquo; he <i>waited</i>&mdash;an&rsquo; <i>waited!</i> But Tolhurst
      never came! So whenst the guerilla war sure he hed escaped by ways
      unknownst he set out ter race him down ter the Cohutty Mountings. But
      Tolhurst had j&rsquo;ined the main body o&rsquo; the Federal Army, an&rsquo; now Ackert is
      showing a clean pair o&rsquo; heels comin&rsquo; back. But he be goin&rsquo; ter take time
      ter raid the Cove&mdash;his hurry will wait fur that! Somebody in
      Tanglefoot&mdash;the Lord only knows who&mdash;showed Tolhurst that
      underground way out ter Greenbrier Cove, through a sorter cave or tunnel
      in the mountings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now&mdash;now&mdash;neighbor&mdash;<i>that&rsquo;s</i> guesswork,&rdquo; remonstrated
      the miller, in behalf of Tanglefoot Cove repudiating the responsibility.
      Perhaps the semi-mercantile occupation of measuring toll sharpens the
      faculties beyond natural endowments, and he began to perceive a certain
      connection between cause and effect inimical to personal interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Waal, that is the way they went, sartain sure,&rdquo; protested the blacksmith.
      &ldquo;I tracked &lsquo;em, the ground bein&rsquo; moist, kase I wanted ter view the marks
      o&rsquo; their horses&rsquo; hoofs. They hev got some powerful triflin&rsquo; blacksmiths in
      the army&mdash;farriers, they call &lsquo;em. I los&rsquo; the trail amongst the rocks
      an&rsquo; ledges down todes the cave&mdash;though it&rsquo;s more like one o&rsquo; them
      tunnels we-uns used ter go through in the railroads in the army, but this
      one was never made with hands; jes&rsquo; hollowed out by Sinking Creek. So I
      got Jube thar ter crope through, an&rsquo; view ef thar war any hoof marks on
      t&rsquo;other side whar the cave opens out in Greenbrier Cove.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; a body would think fur sure ez the armies o&rsquo; hell had been spewed
      out&rsquo;n that black hole,&rdquo; said a lean man whom the glance of the blacksmith
      had indicated as Jube, and who spoke in the intervals of a racking cough
      that seemed as if it might dislocate his bones in its violence. &ldquo;Hoof
      marks hyar&mdash;hoof-marks thar&mdash;as if they didn&rsquo;t rightly know
      which way ter go in the marshy ground &lsquo;bout Sinking Creek. But at last
      they &lsquo;peared ter git tergether, an&rsquo; off they tracked ter the west&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       A paroxysm of coughs intervened, and the attention of the group failed to
      follow the words that they interspersed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They tuk a short cut through the Cove&mdash;they warn&rsquo;t in it a haffen
      hour,&rdquo; stipulated the prudent miller. &ldquo;They came an&rsquo; went like a flash.
      Nobody seen &lsquo;em &lsquo;cept the Brusies, kase they went by thar house&mdash;an&rsquo; 
      ef they hed hed a guide, old Randal Brusie would hev named it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ackert &lsquo;lows he&rsquo;ll hang the guide ef he ketches him,&rdquo; said the
      blacksmith, in a tone of awe. &ldquo;Leastwise that&rsquo;s the word that&rsquo;s &lsquo;goin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Poor Ethelinda! The clutch of cold horror about her heart seemed to stop
      its pulsations for a moment. She saw the still mountains whirl about the
      horizon as if in some weird bewitchment. Her nerveless hands loosened
      their clasp upon the sley and it fell to the ground, clattering on the
      protruding roots of the trees. The sound attracted the miller&rsquo;s attention.
      He fixed his eyes warily upon her, a sudden thought looking out from their
      network of wrinkles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t see no guide whenst they slipped past you-uns&rsquo; house, did ye?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Poor, unwilling casuist! She had an instinct for the truth in its purest
      sense, the innate impulse toward the verities unspoiled by the taint of
      sophistication. Perhaps in the restricted conditions of her life she had
      never before had adequate temptation to a subterfuge. Even now,
      consciously reddening, her eyes drooping before the combined gaze of her
      little world, she had an inward protest of the literal exactness of her
      phrase. &ldquo;Naw sir&mdash;I never seen thar guide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thar now, what did I tell you!&rdquo; the miller exclaimed, triumphantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The blacksmith seemed convinced. &ldquo;Mought hev hed a map,&rdquo; he speculated.
      &ldquo;Them fellers in the army <i>do</i> hev maps. I fund that out whenst I war
      in the service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The group listened respectfully. The blacksmith&rsquo;s practical knowledge of
      the art of war had given him the prestige of a military authority.
      Doubtless some of the acquiescent wights entertained a vague wonder how
      the army contrived to fare onward bereft of his advice. And, indeed,
      despite his maimed estate, his heart was the stoutest that thrilled to the
      iteration of the trumpet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nearer now it was, and once more echoing down the sunset glen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right wheel, trot&mdash;<i>march</i>,&rdquo; he muttered, interpreting the
      sound of the horses&rsquo; hoofs. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a critter company, fur sure!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no splendor of pageant in the raid of the guerilla into the
      Cove. The pines closing above the cleft in the woods masked the entrance
      of the &ldquo;critter company.&rdquo; Once a gleam of scarlet from the guidon flashed
      on the sight. And again a detached horseman was visible in a barren
      interval, reining in his steed on the almost vertical slant, looking the
      centaur in literal presentation. The dull thud of hoofs made itself felt
      as a continuous undertone to the clatter of stirrup and sabre, and now and
      again rose the stirring mandate of the trumpet, with that majestic, sweet
      sweep of sound which so thrills the senses. They were coming indubitably,
      the troop of the dreaded guerilla&mdash;indeed, they were already here.
      For while the sun still glinted on carbine and sabre among the scarlet and
      golden tints of the deciduous growths and the sombre green of the pines on
      the loftier slopes, the vanguard in column of fours were among the gray
      shadows at the mountains&rsquo; base and speeding into the Cove at a
      hand-gallop, for the roads were fairly good when once the level was
      reached. Though so military a presentment, for they were all veterans in
      the service, despite the youth of many, they were not in uniform. Some
      wore the brown jeans of the region, girt with sword-belt and canteen, with
      great spurs and cavalry boots, and broad-brimmed hats, which now and again
      flaunted cords or feathers. Others had attained the Confederate gray,
      occasionally accented with a glimmer of gold where a shoulder-strap or a
      chevron graced the garb. And yet there was a certain homogeneity in their
      aspect, All rode after the manner of the section, with the &ldquo;long stirrup&rdquo;
       at the extreme length of the limb, and the immovable pose in the saddle,
      the man being absolutely stationary, while the horse bounded at agile
      speed. There was the similarity of facial expression, in infinite
      dissimilarity of feature, which marks a common sentiment, origin, and
      habitat. Then, too, they shared something recklessly haphazard, gay,
      defiantly dangerous, that, elusive as it might be to describe, was as
      definitely perceived as the guidon, riding apart at the left, the long
      lance of his pennant planted on his stirrup, bearing himself with a
      certain stately pride of port, distinctly official.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole effect was concentrated in the face of the leader, obviously the
      inspiration of the organization, the vital spark by which it lived; a
      fierce face, intent, commanding. It was burned to a brick-red, and had an
      aquiline nose and a keen gray-green eagle-like eye; on either side auburn
      hair, thick and slightly curling, hung, after the fashion of the time, to
      his coat collar. And this collar and his shoulders were decorated with
      gold lace and the insignia of rank; the uniform was of fine Confederate
      gray, which seemed to contradict the general impression that he was but a
      free-lance or a bushwhacker and operated on his own responsibility. The
      impression increased the terror his name excited throughout the
      countryside with his high-handed and eccentric methods of warfare, and
      perhaps he would not have resented it if he were cognizant of its general
      acceptance.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a look calculated to inspire awe which he flung upon the cowering
      figures before the door of the forge as he suddenly perceived them; and
      detaching himself from the advancing troop, he spurred his horse toward
      them. He came up like a whirlwind.
    </p>
    <p>
      That impetuous gallop could scarcely have carried his charger over the
      building itself, yet there is nothing so overwhelming to the nerves as the
      approaching rush of a speedy horse, and the group flattened themselves
      against the wall; but he drew rein before he reached the door, and
      whirling in the saddle, with one hand on the horse&rsquo;s back, he demanded:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is he? Bring him out!&rdquo; as if all the world knew the object of his
      search and the righteous reason of his enmity. &ldquo;Bring him out! I&rsquo;ll have a
      drumhead court martial&mdash;and he&rsquo;ll swing before sunset!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good evenin&rsquo;, Cap&rsquo;n,&rdquo; the old miller sought what influence might
      appertain to polite address and the social graces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Evenin&rsquo; be damned!&rdquo; cried Ackert, angrily. &ldquo;If you folks in the coves
      want the immunity of non-combatants, by Gawd! you gotter preserve the
      neutrality of non-combatants!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yessir&mdash;that&rsquo;s reason&mdash;that&rsquo;s jestice,&rdquo; said the old squire,
      hastily, whose capacities of ratiocination had been cultivated by the
      exercise of the judicial functions of his modest <i>piepoudre</i> court.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ackert unwillingly cast his eagle eye down upon the cringing old man, as
      if he would rather welcome contradiction than assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s accordin&rsquo; to the articles o&rsquo; war and the law of nations,&rdquo; he
      averred. &ldquo;People take advantage of age and disability&rdquo;&mdash;he glanced at
      the blacksmith, whose left hand mechanically grasped the stump of his
      right arm&mdash;&ldquo;as if that could protect &lsquo;em in acts o&rsquo; treason an&rsquo; 
      treachery;&rdquo; then with a blast of impatience, &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To remonstrate with a whirlwind, to explain to a flash of lightning, to
      soothe and propitiate the fury of a conflagration&mdash;the task before
      the primitive and inexpert Cove-dwellers seemed to partake of this nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cap&rsquo;n&mdash;ef ye&rsquo;d listen ter what I gotter say,&rdquo; began the miller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll listen arterward!&rdquo; exclaimed Ackert, in his clarion voice. He had
      never heard of Jedburgh justice, but he had all the sentiment of that
      famous tribunal who hanged the prisoners first and tried them afterward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cap&rsquo;n,&rdquo; remonstrated the blacksmith, breaking in with hot haste, hurried
      by the commander&rsquo;s gusts of impatience, forgetful that he had no need to
      be precipitate, since he could not produce the recusant if he would.
      &ldquo;Cap&rsquo;n&mdash;Cap&rsquo;n&mdash;bear with us&mdash;we-uns don&rsquo;t know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ackert stared in snorting amaze, a flush of anger dyeing his red cheeks a
      yet deeper red. Of all the subterfuges that he had expected, he had never
      divined this. He shifted front face in his saddle, placed his gauntleted
      right hand on his right side, and held his head erect, looking over the
      wide, rich expanse of the Cove, the corn in the field, and the fodder in
      the shock set amid the barbaric splendors of the wooded autumn mountains
      glowing in the sunset above. He seemed scenting his vengeance with some
      keen sense as he looked, his thin nostrils dilating as sensitively as the
      nostrils of his high-couraged charger now throwing up his head to sniff
      the air, now bending it down as he pawed the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, gentlemen, you have got a mighty pretty piece o&rsquo; country here, and
      good crops, too&mdash;which is a credit to you, seeing that the
      conscription has in and about drafted all the able-bodied mountaineers
      that wouldn&rsquo;t volunteer&mdash;damn &lsquo;em! But I swear by the right hand of
      Jehovah, I&rsquo;ll burn every cabin in the Cove an&rsquo; every blade o&rsquo; forage in
      the fields if you don&rsquo;t produce the man who guided Tol-hurst&rsquo;s cavalry
      out&rsquo;n the trap I&rsquo;d chased &lsquo;em into, or give me a true and satisfactory
      account of him.&rdquo; He raised his gauntleted right hand and shook it in the
      air. &ldquo;So help me God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was all the solemnity of intention vibrating in this fierce
      asseveration, and it brought the aged non-combatants forward in eager
      protestation. The old justice made as if to catch at the bridle rein, then
      desisted. A certain <i>noli me tangere</i> influence about the fierce
      guerilla affected even supplication, and the &ldquo;Squair&rdquo; resorted to logic as
      the more potent weapon of the two.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cap&rsquo;n, Cap&rsquo;n,&rdquo; he urged, with a tremulous, aged jaw, &ldquo;be pleased to
      consider my words. I&rsquo;m a magistrate sir, or I was before the war run the
      law clean out o&rsquo; the kentry. We dun&rsquo;no&rsquo; the guide&mdash;we never seen the
      troops.&rdquo; Then, in reply to an impatient snort of negation: &ldquo;If ye&rsquo;ll cast
      yer eye on the lay of the land, ye&rsquo;ll view how it happened. Thar&rsquo;s the
      road &ldquo;&mdash;he waved his hand toward that vague indentation in the
      foliage that marked the descent into the vale&mdash;&ldquo;an&rsquo; down this e-end
      o&rsquo; the Cove thar&rsquo;s nex&rsquo; ter nobody livin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The spirited equestrian figure was stand-ing as still as a statue; only
      the movement of the full pupils of his eyes, the dilation of the nostrils,
      showed how nearly the matter touched his tense nerves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some folks in the upper e-end of the Cove &lsquo;lowed afterward they hearn a
      hawn; some folks spoke of a shakin&rsquo; of the ground like the trompin&rsquo; of
      horses&mdash;but them troops mus&rsquo; hev passed from the foot o&rsquo; the mounting
      acrost the aidge of the Cove.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Scant haffen mile,&rdquo; put in the blacksmith, &ldquo;down to a sort of cave, or
      tunnel, that runs under the mounting&mdash;yander&mdash;that lets &lsquo;em out
      into Greenbrier Cove.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gawd!&rdquo; exclaimed the guerilla, striking his breast with his clenched,
      gauntleted hand as his eyes followed with the vivacity of actual sight the
      course of the march of the squadron of horse to the point of their
      triumphant vanishment. Despite the vehemence of the phrase the intonation
      was a very bleat of desperation. For it was a rich and rare opportunity
      thus wrested from him by an untoward fate. In all the chaotic chances of
      the Civil War he could hardly hope for its repetition. It was part of a
      crack body of regulars&mdash;Tolhurst&rsquo;s squadron&mdash;that he had
      contrived to drive into this trap, this <i>cul-de-sac</i>, surrounded by
      the infinite fastnesses of the Great Smoky Mountains. It had been a
      running fight, for Tolhurst had orders, as Ackert had found means of
      knowing, to join the main body without delay, and his chief aim was to
      shake off this persistent pursuit with which a far inferior force had
      harassed his march. But for his fortuitous discovery of the underground
      exit from the basin of Tanglefoot Cove, Ackert, ambushed without, would
      have encountered and defeated the regulars in detail as they clambered in
      detachments up the unaccustomed steeps of the mountain road, the woods
      elsewhere being almost impassable jungles of laurel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Success would have meant more to Ackert than the value of the service to
      the cause, than the tumultuous afflatus of victory, than the spirit of
      strife to the born soldier. There had been kindled in his heart a great
      and fiery ambition; he was one of the examples of an untaught military
      genius of which the Civil War elicited a few notable and amazing
      instances. There had been naught in his career heretofore to suggest this
      unaccountable gift, to foster its development. He was the son of a small
      farmer, only moderately well-to-do; he had the very limited education
      which a restricted and remote rural region afforded its youth; he had
      entered the Confederate army as a private soldier, with no sense of
      special fitness, no expectation of personal advancement, only carried on
      the wave of popular enthusiasm. But from the beginning his quality had
      been felt; he had risen from grade to grade, and now with a detached body
      of horse and flying artillery his exploits were beginning to attract the
      attention of corps commanders on both sides, to the gratulation of friends
      and the growing respect of foes. He seemed endowed with the wings of the
      wind; to-day he was tearing up railroad tracks in the lowlands to impede
      the reinforcements of an army; to-morrow the force sent with the express
      intention of placing a period to those mischievous activities heard of his
      feats in burning bridges and cutting trestles in remote sections of the
      mountains. The probabilities could keep no terms with him, and he baffled
      prophecy. He had a quick invention&mdash;a talent for expedients. He
      appeared suddenly when least expected and where his presence seemed
      impossible. He had a gift of military intuition. He seemed to know the
      enemy&rsquo;s plans before they were matured; and ere a move was made to put
      them into execution he was on the ground with troublous obstacles to
      forestall the event in its very inception. He maintained a discipline to
      many commanders impossible. His troops had a unity of spirit that might
      well animate an individual. They endured long fasts, made wonderful forced
      marches on occasion&mdash;all day in the saddle and nodding to the pommel
      all night; it was even said they fought to such exhaustion that when
      dismounted the front rank, lying in line of battle prone upon the ground,
      would fall asleep between volleys, and that the second rank, kneeling to
      fire above them, had orders to stir them with their carbines to insure
      regularity of the musketry. He had the humbler yet even more necessary
      equipment for military success. He could forage his troops in barren
      opportunities; they somehow kept clothed and armed at the minimum of
      expense. Did he lack ammunition&mdash;he made shift to capture a supply
      for his little Par-rott guns that barked like fierce dogs at the
      rear-guard of an enemy or protected his own retreat when it jumped with
      his plans to compass a speedy withdrawal himself. His horses were well
      groomed, well fed, fine travellers, and many showed the brand U.S., for he
      could mount his troop when need required from the corrals of an
      unsuspecting encampment. He was the ideal guerilla, of infinite service to
      his faction in small, significant operations of disproportioned
      importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      What wonder that his name was rife in rumors which flew about the country;
      that soon it was not only &ldquo;the grapevine telegraph&rdquo; that vibrated with the
      sound, but he was mentioned in official despatches; nay, on one signal
      occasion the importance of his dashing exploit was recognized by the
      commander of the Army Corps in a general order published to specially
      commend it. Naturally his spirit rose to meet these expanding liberties of
      achievement. He looked for further promotion&mdash;for eminence. In a
      vague glimmer, growing ever stronger and clearer, he could see himself in
      the astral splendor of the official stars of a major-general&mdash;for in
      the far day of the anticipated success of the Confederacy he looked to be
      an officer of the line.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now suddenly this light was dimmed; his laurels were wilting. What
      prestige would the capture of Tolhurst have conferred! Never had a golden
      opportunity like this been lost&mdash;by what uncovenanted chance had
      Tolhurst escaped!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He must have had a guide! Right here in the Cove!&rdquo; Ackert exclaimed.
      &ldquo;Nobody outside would know a hole in the ground, a cave, a water-gap, a
      tunnel like that! Where&rsquo;s the man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naw, sir&mdash;naw, Cap&rsquo;n! Nobody viewed the troop but one gal person an&rsquo; 
      she &lsquo;lowed she never seen no guide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The charger whirled under the touch of the hand on the rein, and Ackert&rsquo;s
      eyes scanned with a searching intentness the group.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s this girl&mdash;you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the old squire with most unwelcome officiousness seized Ethelinda&rsquo;s arm
      and hurried her forward, her heart sank within her. For one moment the
      guerilla&rsquo;s fiery, piercing eyes dwelt upon her as she stood looking on,
      her delicately white face grown deathly pallid, her golden hair
      frivolously blowsed in the wind, which tossed the full skirts of her
      lilac-hued calico gown till she seemed poised on the very wings of flight.
      Her sapphire eyes, bluer than ever azure skies could seem, sought to gaze
      upward, but ever and anon their long-lashed lids fluttered and fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was quick of perception.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>You</i> have no call to be afraid,&rdquo; he remarked&mdash;a sort of gruff
      upbraiding, as if her evident trepidation impugned his justice in
      reprisal. &ldquo;Come, you can guide me. Show me just where they came in, and
      just where they got out&mdash;damn &lsquo;em!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She could scarcely control her terror when she saw that he intended her to
      ride with him to the spot, yet she feared even more to draw back, to
      refuse. He held out one great spurred boot. Her little low-cut shoe looked
      tiny upon it as she stepped up. He swung her to the saddle behind him, and
      the great warhorse sprang forward so suddenly, with such long, swift
      strides, that she swayed precariously for a moment and was glad to catch
      the guerilla&rsquo;s belt&mdash;to seize, too, with an agitated clutch, his
      right gauntlet that he held backward against his side. His fingers
      promptly closed with a reassuring grasp on hers, and thus skimming the red
      sunset-tide they left behind them the staring group about the blacksmith
      shop, which the cavalrymen had now approached, watering their horses at
      the trough and lifting the saddles to rest the animals from the
      constriction of the pressure of the girths.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon the guerilla and the girl disappeared in the distance; the fences
      flew by; the shocks of corn seemed all a-trooping down the fields; the
      evening star in the red haze above the purple western mountains had spread
      its invisible pinions, and was a-wing above their heads. Presently the
      heavy shadows of the looming wooded range, darkening now, showing only
      blurred effects of red and brown and orange, fell upon them, and the
      guerilla checked the pace, for the horse was among boulders and rough
      ledges that betokened the dry bed of a stream. Great crags had begun to
      line the way, first only on one marge of the channel; then; the clifty
      banks appeared on the other side, and at length a deep> black-arched
      opening yawned beneath the mountains, glooming with sepulchral shadows; in
      the silence one might hear drops trickling vaguely and the sudden hooting
      of an owl from within.
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew up his horse abruptly, and contemplated the grim aperture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So they came into Tanglefoot down the road, and went out of the Cove by
      this tunnel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yessir!&rdquo; she piped. What had befallen her voice? what appalled eerie
      squeak was this! She cleared her throat timorously. &ldquo;They couldn&rsquo;t hev
      done it later in the fall season. Tanglefoot Creek gits ter runnin&rsquo; with
      the fust rains.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; Tolhurst knew that too! He must have had a guide&mdash;a guide that
      knows the Cove like I know the palm of my hand! Well, I&rsquo;ll catch him yet,
      sometime. I&rsquo;ll hang him! I&rsquo;ll hang him&mdash;if I have to grow a tree
      a-pur-pose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What strange influence had betided the landscape? Around and around
      circled the great stationary mountains anchored in the foundations of the
      earth. It was a long moment before they were still again&mdash;perhaps,
      indeed, it was the necessity of guarding her balance on the fiery steed, a
      new cause of apprehension, that paradoxically steadied Ethelinda&rsquo;s nerves.
      Ackert had dismounted, throwing the reins over his arm. He had caught
      sight of the hoof marks along the moist sandy spaces of the channel, mute
      witness in point of number, and a guaranty of the truth of her story. A
      sudden glitter arrested his eyes. He stooped and picked up a broken
      belt-buckle with the significant initials U.S. yet showing upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hang that guide yet,&rdquo; he muttered, his eyes dark with angry
      conviction, his face lowering with fury. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hang him&mdash;I won&rsquo;t
      expect to prove it p&rsquo;int blank. Jes&rsquo; let me git a mite o&rsquo; suspicion, an&rsquo; 
      I&rsquo;ll guarantee the slipknot!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She could never understand her motive, her choice of the moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cap&rsquo;n Ackert,&rdquo; she trembled forth. There was so much significance in her
      tone that, standing at her side, he looked up in sudden expectation. &ldquo;I
      tole ye the truth whenst I say I <i>seen</i> no guide&rdquo;&mdash;he made a
      gesture of impatience; he had no time for twice-told tales&mdash;&ldquo;kase&mdash;kase
      the guide war&mdash;war&mdash;myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The clear twilight fell full on his amazed, upturned face and the storm of
      fury it concentrated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you do it fur?&rdquo; he thundered, &ldquo;you limb o&rsquo; perdition!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jes&rsquo; ter help him some. He&mdash;he&mdash;he&mdash;would hev been
      capshured.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He would indeed! The guerilla was very terrible to look upon as his brow
      corrugated, and his upturned eyes, with the light of the sky within them,
      flashed ominously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You little she-devil!&rdquo; he cried, and then speech seemed to fail him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had begun to shiver and shed tears and emit little gusts of quaking
      sobs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I be so feared&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; she whimpered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;but&mdash;you mustn&rsquo;t hang&mdash;<i>nobody else</i> on
      s&rsquo;picion!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a vague change in the expression of his face. He still stood
      beside the saddle, with the reins over his arm, while the horse threw his
      head almost to the ground and again tossed it aloft in his impatient
      weariness of the delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; now you are captured yourself,&rdquo; he said, sternly. &ldquo;You are
      accountable fur your actions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She burst into a paroxysm of sobs. &ldquo;I never went ter tell! I meant ter
      keep the secret! The folks in the Cove dun&rsquo;no&rsquo; nuthin&rsquo;. But&mdash;oh, ye
      <i>mustn&rsquo;t</i> s&rsquo;picion nobody else&mdash;ye <i>mustn&rsquo;t</i> hang nobody
      else!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Once more that indescribable change upon his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You showed him the way to this pass yourself? Tell the truth!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He war ridin&rsquo; his horse-critter&mdash;&lsquo;tain&rsquo;t ez fast, nor fine, nor fat
      ez yourn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stroked the glossy mane with a sort of mechanical pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so he went plumb through the cave?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; all the troop&mdash;they kindled pine-knots fur torches.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He glanced about him at the convenient growths.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And they came out all safe in Greenbrier!&rdquo; He winced. How the lost
      opportunity hurt him!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yessir. In Greenbrier Cove.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he pay you in gold?&rdquo; sneered Ackert. &ldquo;Or in greenbacks? Or mebbe in
      Cornfed money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t hev his gold.&rdquo; She drew herself up proudly, though the tears
      were still coursing down her cheeks. &ldquo;So he gin me a present&mdash;a whole
      passel o&rsquo; coffee in my milk-piggin.&rdquo; Then to complete a candid confession
      she detailed the disposition she had made of this rare and precious luxury
      at the rebel smallpox camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes seemed to dilate as they gazed up at her. &ldquo;Jesus Gawd!&rdquo; he
      exclaimed, with uncouth profanity. But the phrase was unfamiliar to her,
      and she caught at it with a meaning all her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s jes&rsquo; it! Folks in gineral don&rsquo;t think o&rsquo; <i>them</i>, &lsquo;cept ter
      git out o&rsquo; thar way; an&rsquo; nobody keers fur <i>them</i>, but kase Jesus is
      Gawd He makes <i>somebody</i> remember them wunst in a while! An&rsquo; they did
      seem passable glad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A vague sweet fragrance was on the vesperal air; some subtle distillation
      of asters or jewel-weed or &ldquo;mountain-snow,&rdquo; and the leafage of crimson
      sumac and purple sweet-gum and yellow hickory and the late ripening
      frost-grapes&mdash;all in the culmination of autumnal perfection; more
      than one star gleamed whitely palpitant in a sky that was yet blue and
      roseate with a reminiscence of sunset; a restful sentiment, a brief truce
      stilled the guerilla&rsquo;s tempestuous pulse as he continued to stand beside
      his horse&rsquo;s head while the girl waited, seated on the saddle blanket.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he spoke to an unexpected intent. &ldquo;Ye took a power o&rsquo; risk in
      goin&rsquo; nigh that Confederate pest-camp&mdash;an&rsquo; yit ye&rsquo;re fur the Union
      an&rsquo; saved a squadron from capture!&rdquo; he upbraided the inconsistency in a
      soft incidental drawl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I be fur the Union,&rdquo; she trembled forth the dread avowal. &ldquo;But
      somehows I can&rsquo;t keep from holpin&rsquo; any I kin. They war rebs&mdash;an&rsquo; it
      war Yankee coffee&mdash;an&rsquo; I dun&rsquo;no&rsquo;&mdash;I jes&rsquo; dun&rsquo;no&rsquo;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she hesitated he looked long at her with that untranslated gaze. Then
      he fell ponderingly silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps the revelation of the sanctities of a sweet humanity for a holy
      sake, blessing and blessed, had illumined his path, had lifted his eyes,
      had wrought a change in his moral atmosphere spiritually suffusive,
      potent, revivifying, complete. &ldquo;She is as good as the saints in the Bible&mdash;an&rsquo; 
      plumb beautiful besides,&rdquo; he muttered beneath his fierce mustachios.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more he gazed wonderingly at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expect to do some courtin&rsquo; in this kentry when the war is over,&rdquo; the
      guerilla said, soberly, reaching down to readjust the reins. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t
      got time now. Will <i>you</i> be waiting fur me here in Tanglefoot Cove&mdash;if
      I promise not to hang you fur your misdeeds right off now?&rdquo; He glanced up
      with a sudden arch jocularity.
    </p>
    <p>
      She burst out laughing gleefuly in the tumult of her joyous reassurance,
      as she laid her tremulous fingers in his big gauntlet when he insisted
      that they should shake hands as on a solemn compact. Forthwith he mounted
      again, and the great charger galloped back, carrying double, in the red
      afterglow of the sunset, to the waiting group before the flaring doors of
      the forge.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fine flower of romance had blossomed incongruously in that eager heart
      in those fierce moments of the bitterness of defeat. Life suddenly had a
      new meaning, a fair and fragrant promise, and often and again he looked
      over his shoulder at the receding scene when the trumpets sang &ldquo;to horse,&rdquo;
       and in the light of the moon the guerilla rode out of Tanglefoot Cove.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Ethelinda saw him never again. All the storms of fate overwhelmed the
      Confederacy with many a rootless hope and many a plan and pride. In lieu
      of the materialization of the stalwart ambition of distinction that had
      come to dominate his life, responsive to the discovery of his peculiar and
      inherent gifts, his destiny was chronicled in scarce a line of the printed
      details of a day freighted with the monstrous disaster of a great battle;
      in common with others of the &ldquo;missing&rdquo; his bones were picked by the
      vultures till shoved into a trench, where a monument rises to-day to
      commemorate an event and not a commander. Nevertheless, for many years the
      flare of the first red leaves in the cleft among the pines on the eastern
      slope of Tanglefoot Cove brought to Ethelinda&rsquo;s mind the gay flutter of
      the guidon, and in certain sonorous blasts of the mountain wind she could
      hear martial echoes of the trumpets of the guerilla.
